        I have been working as a mathematics teacher at Sejong Academy of Science and Arts (SASA) since March 2017. SASA is the first school for gifted students in science and arts established in South Korea. I have enjoyed a rewarding time at SASA, interacting with diverse students and excellent colleagues. At SASA, I teach a variety of courses, including core mathematics subjects as well as additional subjects such as Calculus I,II(AP), Linear Algebra(AP), Discrete Mathematics, and Integrated Mathematics.
